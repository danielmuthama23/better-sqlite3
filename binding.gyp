# To modify the given .gyp file to use dynamic linking for the better_sqlite3 target, you would need to make changes to the target configuration.
# Dynamic linking typically involves linking against shared libraries (.so files on Linux).
# Here's how you could modify the file:

# Here's what I changed:

# For the better_sqlite3 target:
# Inside the 'conditions' block for Linux, I added -shared to the ldflags.
# This is the flag that specifies that the output should be a shared library.
# I retained the existing flags -Wl,-Bsymbolic and -Wl,--exclude-libs,ALL as you had in the original file.
# Remember that modifying build systems can sometimes be complex, and you should make sure that the rest of your build setup (such as dependencies, header paths, etc.) is compatible with dynamic linking.

# Also, consider checking if there are additional changes needed for other platforms you might be targeting, and ensure that your build system is set up to correctly generate and handle shared libraries.
